## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Context API
- Zod
- BEM CSS class naming convention

### What I learned

Well this was a good challenge as I was challenging to make it in a well organized way, to ensure code reusability and to avoid data inconsistency.

I did got the chance to practice react more with this project and I also used zod for validation.Overall the main thing I practiced during making this is how to organize code and deal with a lot of components.
